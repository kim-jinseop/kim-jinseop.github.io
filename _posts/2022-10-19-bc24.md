# - 3D application example
- Photo refocusing
    - Defocusing a photo using depth map
        - 1.Set a depth threshold range [\\(D_{min}, D_{max}\\)] you want to foscus
        - 2.Compute a mask of "focusing area" and "defocusing area" by depth map thresholding 
        - 3.Generate a blurred version of the input image
        - 4.Compute "Masked focused image" and "Masked defocused image"
        - 5.Blend masked images to generate a refocused image
